### How to contribute

It's early days for sodan and we're starting out by prototyping two ideas for the app. Check them out under [Projects](https://github.com/qcldn/sodan/projects).

If you'd like to contribute, please join the channel #sodan on the Queer Code London slack (you can join our slack [here](https://slackinvite-qcldn.herokuapp.com/)).
